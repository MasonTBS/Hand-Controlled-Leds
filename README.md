# Hand-Controlled-Leds
I've used OpenCV and Mediapipe libraries to achieve it.
For the software I needded an arduino sketch and a python file
For the Hardware I needed a couple of leds and resistors and an arduino.
First upload the Arduino sketch to your card then run the python file, yur PC's camera 
will detect then your fingers.
To Turn the leds on and off slowly move your thumb right and left horizontally 
and change the distance between your thumb and index.
This is an initation for a hand controlled robot.
I hope you enjoy it.
